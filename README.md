# LithoResistSimulator
A Neat Litho-Resist Simulator

The litho model part is forked from FuILT. We calibrate the model parameters on real designs.

We implemented the resist model from scratch and refined it with a calibration set.


# Quick Start


Install FuILT
```
cd /path/to/FuILT
pip3 install -e .
